# Preserving-Communication-using-Adversarial-Neural-Cryptograph
In general, the Neural Networks will be made to learn the secret key information and to conceal it from other neural networks in the application network. The main aim of this project is to achieve the confidentiality in a multi-agent system and the corresponding properties in the form establishing an adversary relationship between the receiver and the attacker. Alice and Bob communicate with each other and Oscar will try to Eavesdrop the message. In this, we tried not to use conventional cryptographic algorithms but try to train end-to-end adversarially. The main goal is to significantly demonstrate the performance of encryption and decryption, and to implement the working model that can apply the operations ultimately to meet the requirements and confidentiality standards
